Currently XEN does not have a backup API. That means, that Xen virtual machines can not be backed up online with using the existing XEN tools.
Backup approach :
	1- Create an LVM snapshot of the logical volume where the VM is stored
	2- Mount this snapshot into the filesystem
	3- Perform a pathbackup with SEP sesam from the mountpoint of the LVM snapshot
	4- Dismount the snapshot from the filesystem after backup
	5- Delete the snapshot
